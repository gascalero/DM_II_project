## Continuous Variables

- **Date of birth**: Should be converted to a continuous age variable.

- **Healthcare costs**:
    - Contains negative values. Need to interpret the reason behind this. (Could it be related to the 'insurance cost' variable class? Could it be a reimbursement?)
    - Should be scaled due to the magnitude of its range.

- **Mortality rate per 100K**: Contains negative values. Most likely need to impute or change its value.

- **Outliers detected in**:
    - 'Healthcare Costs'
    - 'Incidence Rate per 100K'
    - 'Mortality Rate per 100K'
    - 'Tumor Size (mm)'

## Categorical Variables

- **Marital status**: Should be removed as it is completely empty.

- **Transfusion history**: Should be removed as it only contains null values.

- **Gender**: Contains an additional class 'P'.
    - (Could it be due to an undefined gender or a minority community?)

- **Healthcare Access**: Contains an additional class '?'.
    - Could be due to unknown information due to unique customer factors (e.g., location, rural or urban area?)

- **Urban or Rural**: Contains repeated classes written differently.

- **Diabetes History**: Almost the entire distribution falls into the 'No' class. Does not add much information. Consider removing.

## Feature Engineering

- Is there a correspondence between the classes of 'Insurance cost' and 'Insurance Status'?

- Could 'Obesity BMI' and 'Diet risk' be highly correlated? Both are categorical variables.
